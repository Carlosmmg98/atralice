### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm **Toni Tralice**, I'm a Ed Tech entrepreneur from TucumÃ¡n, Argentina. I co-founded the [first coding Bootcamp in Latam](https://plataforma5.la/).

Check out my lastest startup: [**Henry**](https://www.soyhenry.com/), and online school with zero up-front cost. We invest in students education, and they repay us only when they get a job.

I would love to talk anything Education and Technology related, you can reach me at atralice@gmail.com .
